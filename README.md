Laxstats
========

This is the current version on www.laxstats.net. Written in an early PHP5 or PHP4 version in late 2004 and early 2005, it is pre-OOP and is a real bowl of spaghetti of procedural writing. While a very rich site, it not a piece of programming I'm particularly proud of except for the animated design-your-own playbook.
