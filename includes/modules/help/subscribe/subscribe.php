		<p class="letterText"><b>Pricing:</b> For individual teams, a Laxstats subscription is $200 per  season. For camps or larger associations putting more pressure on our host, pricing varies - please contact us for details. There is no set-up charge, and your subscription gives you access to all the features and functionality we offer. If you want to upload prior history, the cost is $30 per season.</p>
		<p class="letterText"><b>Term:</b> Purchasing a subscription lets you save and edit information related to a single season for as long as the site exists. That means there's no date after which the doors shut and you're locked out.</p>
		<p class="letterText"><b>Payment:</b> Payment can be made by check or money order, payable to Kaaterskil Management, and mailed to 45 Avon Road, Wellesley, MA 02482. Please include your town and state on the check so we can match it up to your registration in the Manager's Office. Once we receive your payment, we'll notify you by email that you can begin working on the system.</p>
		<p class="letterText"><b>Fine Print:</b> By purchasing a subscription, you agree to the website Terms of Use as described in the link below. (Now might be a good time to actually read it.) If you're interested in backups, disaster recovery and other tricky technical issues, please contact the webmaster.</p>
