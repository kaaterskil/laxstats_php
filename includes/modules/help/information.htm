		<p>Once you've finished, come back here to the Manager's office to submit your game as Final so everyone else can see the results. <b>Careful though - take your time - once a game is submitted as Final, it's set in stone and you cannot retrieve it for modification.</b></p>

		<p>One thing about life is that people come and go, grow older, and get more hair in all the wrong places. Laxstats is built to cover multiple seasons, which means different rosters and different coaching staff. Here is where you can manage all that coming and going. You create a new season by clicking the "Add Season" button. You edit or delete existing seasons by clicking on the icons to the left of each entry. Obviously, if you've entered games, you won't be able to delete the related season - we're not that dumb!</p>

		<p>Creating a new game means entering in some basic information before you get to the good stuff, the stats, that is:
			<ol>
				<li><b>Game Date:</b> Laxstats needs to know a game date so that it can apply the correct roster of players. But if you're entering your season schedule well before it happens, you might not know for sure the date or time. That's OK: Enter the date as best you know it - you can change it later if you need to so everyone stays current. To enter a date, type slashes and a four-digit year, e.g. mm/dd/yyyy.</li>
				<li><b>Start time:</b> Same deal here - Enter a playng time as best you know it. You can change it later if you need to. There are two ways to enter a time:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Using a 24-hour clock</b>, type the hours and minutes separated by a colon, e.g. hh:mm.</li>
						<li><b>Using a 12-hour clock</b>, type the hours and minutes separated by a colon, adding "am" or "pm" with a space after the time, e.g. 4:00 pm. <i>Note that there are no periods in "am" or "pm"</i>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Playing Field:</b> Select a field from the drop-down menu. If you don't see your field listed, then you've got exit this area, create your field, and then come back. Sorry, dude, but that's how it goes.</li>
				<li><b>Home team:</b> Select a team from the drop-down menu. If you don't see the correct team, then you've got to exit this area, create the team, and then come back. Doh!</li>
				<li><b>Visiting team:</b> Same deal as for the home team.</li>
				<li><b>Season:</b> Check this box if the game is a post-season game. Leave it blank for a regular season game.</li>
				<li><b>Game Type:</b> Check this box if the game is an exhibition or non-league game. Leave it blank for all league games. <i>NOTE: Every game is added to your win-loss record, so don't enter scrimmages or practice games.</i></li>
				<li><b>Weather:</b> Obviously, you can't enter information here until the game happens.</li>
				<li><b>Referee, Umpire and Field Judge, Scorekeeper, Timekeeper:</b> If you want to track them, put something down. Otherwise, fuggedaboutit!</li>
			</ol>
		To save your work, hit the Save button. You must have at least the required information (identified with a red asterisk) before a game can be saved. If you need to start over, hit the Reset button.<p></p>
		<p>Hopefully, Laxstats is a smart system. It will report back to you if there's a problem with your entry, like if you're duplicating a game you've already entered or if you've typed in some bad data. You can't miss the notes when they happen - they're in embarrassingly bright red.</p>
		<p>Once you save your game, Laxstats takes you to a new screen where you can start entering game results. If you're not ready to do that yet, return to the Manager's Office or go anywhere else you'd like. Once you've entered your data, checked it for accuracy and are perfectly happy with it, go back to the manager's office and submit it as Final. <b>Careful though - once a game is submitted as Final, it's set in stone and you cannot retrieve it for modification.</b></p>

For example, you can write about the week's game, inform everyone of schedule changes, or construct a play in the playbook and tell your team about it here. Have fun, be creative and go motivate your team!</p>
		<p>Letters show up on your blog in the Coach's Corner. Emails don't, but are saved here where you can review them.</p>

		<p>For the most part, writing a letter to post to your Coach's Corner is easy. Just type in a date (like, um, today), a title, and the text itself, and hit "Save".</p>
		<p><b>SENDING AN EMAIL:</b></p>
		<p>To send an email, select 'Send as Email' from the drop-down menu at the upper right of the window. The window will change to reveal selection lists and an address field. You have the ability to send emails to groups or individuals:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Groups: </b> Click the appropriate checkboxes. You can send an email to your players, staff and/or parents. The email will be sent to anyone in the group who has an email address stored in the system.</li>
				<li><b>Individuals: </b>You can send an email to one or more individuals. Everyone with an address in the system is listed in the drop-down menu at the right. Select a name and their address appears automatically in the 'Other' field. If you want to send an email to someone not in the system, simply type their address directly into the 'Other' field. Multiple addresses should be separated by a comma and a space.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>NOTE: Do not include yourself in the email.</b> A copy will be sent automatically to the address you used when you registered with Laxstats.<p></p>
		<p>While you can send emails and attachments, Laxstats cannot receive any incoming mail and isn't intended to replace your own email system. All mail you send will show the address you used when you registered with Laxstats in the 'From' field.</p>
		<p><b>ADDING AN ATTACHMENT</b></p>
		<p>Laxstats lets you upload or email an attachment. Documents might include a registration or health form or any other kind of letter or form. Acceptable formats are Microsoft Word &reg; or Adobe Acrobat &reg; documents. All documents must have either a '.doc' or '.pdf' extension to the filename and be less than 1MB in size.</p>
		<p>To add an attachment, click the Browse button near the bottom of the window. A standard dialog box will appear to help you find the document you want to upload.</p>
		<p><b>FORMATTING TEXT</b></p>
		<p>Technology is getting better, and a new horizon is being able to <b>format text that you type on the web</b> (Gee, I didn't realize you couldn't do that.) Yep, that's right, this is a new thing and not all browsers support it. If your browser does, you'll be able to <b>BOLD</b>, <span style="color:#990000; "><b>HIGHLIGHT</b></span>, or <i>ITALICIZE</i> your text, making it more interesting and compelling to your readers. We've identified most browsers that don't support this technology, so you'll know if you can't do it.</p>
		<p><b>To format text</b>, select a word or a string of words and click on one of the formatting buttons.</p>
		<p><b>NOTE: Formatting text won't change the way it looks to you here in this window!</b> Clicking a formatting button inserts some HTML code into your letter so that when you look at it in the Coach's Corner, your browser will display it right. Unless you're familiar with HTML, we suggest that you don't mess with the code or else it might screw up not just this letter but all the other letters you've posted, too. <b>Our advice?</b> Finish writing your letter in plain text, then save it. After it's saved, open it up again (by clicking the pencil icon) and then try some formatting. If you don't like what you've done, hit the "Reset" button and everything reverts back to the way it was when you last saved it.</p>

		<p><b>NOTE:</b> Your browser must be Javascript/Java-enabled in order to load and save plays. Also, many Macintosh browsers and browsers running on Windows 3.1 (among others) don't communicate well with plug-ins like this animation, so loading plays from the server could be a bit spotty. So much for the limits of technology...</p>
		<p><b>Loading a Saved Play:</b> Select a play from the pull-down menu.</p>
		<p>If you have designed and saved a game and you don't see it in the drop-down menu, you may need to refresh your screen.</p>
		<p><b>Creating a New Play:</b>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Draw a path for a player to travel:</b> Click a <i>Path</i> button and use your mouse to draw a line in the direction you want your player to travel. The path stops when you lift up on the mouse. You can draw any combination of paths - the program will snap a new segment onto the end of the previous one if you click your mouse near it. Finish off by terminating your path with a <i>Tee</i> or an <i>Arrow</i> end. (Select the line first by clicking on it to highlight it blue, then click on one of the <i>End</i> buttons.)</li>
				<li><b>Create a player:</b> Click a <i>Player</i> button and drag your player icon over to the path you drew.</li>
				<li><b>Link the player to the path:</b> Get your player icon to touch any end or corner in the path, and click the <i>Link</i> button when the dialog box appears. The icon will snap to the starting point. (If you make a mistake, select the icon or the path to highlight it blue, then click the <i>Clear</i> button to erase.)</li>
				<li><b>Set your player's timeline. </b>All players' movements are adjustable in time. Double-click a player icon to bring up the timeline bar. You have a maximium of 10 seconds for your play. Drag the edges of the bars left or right to either delay start, shorten the play (speed up the runner), or have your player wait between path segments.</li>
				<li><b>Add more players:</b> Add as many players and  pathways as you want.</li>
				<li><b>Add the ball:</b> Select a player by clicking on it and click the <i>Ball</i> button.</li>
				<li><b>Add pass and shoot paths:</b> Click the <i>Line</i> button under <i>Balls</i> and draw paths to pass or shoot. Place your mouse near a node on a player's path and then move it to another player's path node or to the goal. The pass/shoot path will snap into place.</li>
				<li><b>Adjust timelines:</b> Make sure your player will be there to catch the ball when it gets passed or it will get thrown away! Double-click a player icon to bring up the timeline again.</li>
				<li><b>Run the play:</b> Press <i>Run</i> to see the play in action.  <i>Reset</i> brings everyone back to their original position.</li>
				<li><b>Save it!</b> If you have at least one player and a travel path, you can save your play by clicking the <i>Save Play</i> button. Enter a title for your play and some brief comments. Rest assured that your play can ONLY be viewed from this team page.</li>
			</ol>
		<p></p>
		<p>Since this program is still in beta-testing, it may be a little buggy. If you have a problem, hit the <i>Refresh</i> button on your browser (or the <i>Clr All</i> button in the application) to wipe out the whole thing. <b>Send us your comments, found bugs and wish list!</b></p>

		<p>Adding photos to the public side of your webiste is a quick way to build team spirit and interest, particularly if the photos are good!</p>
		<p>Uploading images is easy. You don't need to create a separate thumbnail - Laxstats does that automatically for you - just enter the information into the form, locate the full-size image you want to post, and click the <b>Upload</b> button. Information you may want or need to track includes:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Title:</b> Enter a short name or title for the image.</li>
				<li><b>Photo Date:</b> Laxstats organizes and groups photos by date. If the image you want to upload is a game photo, the date you enter must match the game date. If the photo was taken, say, at a car wash fundraiser, enter the date of the event. <b>Note: Make sure that the season identified in the drop-down menu near the top of the screen corresponds to the year of the photo. Oherwise, you'll be storing your photo in the wrong season!</b></li>
				<li><b>Game:</b> If the photo was taken at a game, select the game from the drop-down menu. Otherwise, leave it blank. If you don't see the game, oops!, you might have the wrong season or the game wasn't created yet.</li>
				<li><b>Photographer:</b> Sometimes it makes sense to record who took the photo. If you are uploading an image from a professional service or media source, attribution may be required, such as "Baltimore Sun photo".</li>
				<li><b>Note:</b> If the shot is a particularly good one, you may want to write a brief caption.</li>
				<li><b>Image:</b> Use the browse button to locate the path to the image on your computer. This is a similar action to attaching documents to an email.</li>
			</ul>
			<a name="photoSizeLimit">Currently</a>, Laxstats does not limit how many images you may store. However, in order not to overload our host or slow download times, <b>we currently accept images only 64K or less in size (65,536 bytes)</b>. Also, all images must be in JPEG format, that is, with a .jpg or .jpeg suffix.
		<p></p>
		<p>There are many ways you can optimize your images to stay within this limit. However, most of them may require the use of some sort of image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe ImageReady, etc. or a drawing program.</p>
		<p>Using your editing software, you can usually find a balance between image size and resolution. Typically 800 x 534 pixels is a good size. And, given that this is not ESPN's website, medium quality resolution should suffice. Obviously, smaller images at higher resolution will work too, but we're not sure if you <i>really</i> want to see individual sweat droplets spraying off somebody as they're being checked. Then again...</p>

		<p>Since all games have to happen <i>somewhere</i>, Laxstats provides the opportunity to record not just driving instructions for directionally-challenged fans but also surface conditions. To edit or delete a field, click the icons to the left of any entry. To add a field, click the button at the right, and a new window will pop-up: Enter the following information:
			<ol>
				<li><b>State</b>.</li>
				<li><b>Town:</b> This obviously doesn't have to match your team's town, although Laxstats will look for a close match in determining home vs. visitor status.</li>
				<li><b>Surface:</b> Select from the following choices:
					<ul>
						<li>Grass - practice;</li>
						<li>Grass - conmpetition;</li>
						<li>Turf; or</li>
						<li>Other/Unknown.</li>
